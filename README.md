# Home Pages

A collection of home pages that I've used over time.

## The Me Pages

* [metroMe](#metroMe)
* [miniMe](#miniMe)
* [Something New](#new)

## <a name="metroMe"></a>metroMe

A metro UI based 'start page'. Built using [Metro UI CSS](https://github.com/olton/Metro-UI-CSS/).

I got bored of it, and also, I couldn't get it to work nicely on mobile devices.

## <a name="miniMe"></a>miniMe

A minimalistic home page, the design of which was stolen from the home pages of two different people and merged together to get the best of both.

The typewriter effect part is credited to [Manuel Moreale](http://manuelmoreale.com/).

While the table-of-contents design belongs to [Yaron Schoen](http://yaronschoen.com/).

I just stole the Lego pieces and built the house.

## <a name="new"></a>newMe

I think its about time I got a new home page.

I like the typewriter effect so I think I'll stick with it for now. But the TOC part needs to go, I plan to create a simplistic menu right at the top.

I don't have any solid ideas ready yet, but then, I never have had...

This time the task (of stealing) is going to be a bit easy as I know of place which has a dragon stockpile of loot ready for offering - [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops)

If you haven't visited those guys before. Pleas Do. It is a haven for idea thieves like me.
