# Homepages

*Status: As much as I would like to create a new homepage, I just can't find the time. Life :/*

A collection of homepages that I've used over time. 

The live versions of the pages are hosted [here](http://dufferzafar.github.io/homepages). Go check them out.

## The Me Pages

* [miniMe](#miniMe)
* [Something New](#new)

## <a name="metroMe"></a>metroMe

A metro UI based 'start page'. Built using [Metro UI CSS](https://github.com/olton/Metro-UI-CSS/).

I got bored of it, and also, I couldn't get it to work nicely on mobile devices.

## <a name="miniMe"></a>miniMe

A minimalistic homepage, the design of which was stolen from the sites of two different people and merged together to get the best of both. This is called stealing the Lego pieces and building the house.

The typewriter effect part is credited to [Manuel Moreale](http://manuelmoreale.com/).

While the table-of-contents design belongs to [Yaron Schoen](http://yaronschoen.com/).

## <a name="new"></a>newMe

I think its about time I got a new landing page.

I like the typewriter effect so I think I'll stick with it for now. But the TOC part needs to go, I plan to create a simplistic menu right at the top.

I don't have any solid ideas ready yet, but then, I never have had...

This time the task (of stealing) is going to be a bit easy as I know of a place which has a stockpile of loot ready for offering - [Codrops](http://tympanus.net/codrops). If you haven't visited the site before. Pleas Do. It is a haven for idea thieves like me.

Maybe I'll use [Impress.js](bartaz.github.io/impress.js/) but first I need to hack around a bit with it and understand the basics, before I can begin to create something totally kickass.
